Restaurant Management: Supports a pre-defined set of restaurants, with the potential for expansion.

Menu Handling: Parses and displays restaurant menus with corresponding item descriptions and prices.

Order Processing: Facilitates user input for quantities of desired dishes.

Billing System: Calculates and displays the total cost with and without GST, generating a comprehensive bill.

Database Interaction: Connects to an SQL database using appropriate libraries (e.g., sqlite3) to store order information securely.


# Technical Stack:
